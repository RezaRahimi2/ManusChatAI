Based on all the information gathered, let me provide you with a comprehensive guide on how to create a planner agent that can plan user tasks and provide detailed steps to reach goals, similar to Genspark.ai's Super Agent.

# Creating a Planner Agent for Task Planning and Execution

Planning agents are a critical component in modern AI systems that help users break down complex goals into manageable steps and execute them efficiently. This guide will show you how to build a planner agent similar to the approach used by Genspark.ai's Super Agent.

## Understanding Planner Agents

A planner agent is an AI system that can:

1. Understand a user's high-level goal
2. Break down the goal into logical subtasks
3. Create an execution plan for those subtasks
4. Execute or guide the execution of those subtasks
5. Monitor progress and adjust the plan when needed

## Key Architecture Components

Based on the information gathered about successful planning agents, here's the essential architecture you'll need to implement:

![Agent Architecture Diagram](https://blog.langchain.dev/content/images/2024/02/plan-and-execute.png)

### 1\. Core Components

#### The Planning Module

This is the "brain" of your agent that analyzes user tasks and generates plans:

```hljs hljs python
Copyclass PlanningModule:
    def __init__(self, llm):
        self.llm = llm

    def create_plan(self, user_task):
        """
        Break down a complex user task into subtasks
        """
        planning_prompt = f"""
        % Role:
        You are an AI assistant helping a user plan a task. You have access to tools to help execute tasks.

        % Task:
        Check the user's query and provide a plan for completing the task. Do not execute the plan, only outline the steps.

        % Instructions:
        Create a detailed plan with ordered steps to accomplish the user's goal.
        Be specific about what tools might be needed for each step.
        Break complex steps into smaller substeps when appropriate.

        % User Task:
        {user_task}

        % Output:
        Provide a detailed, step-by-step plan for accomplishing the task.
        Each step should be numbered and include what needs to be done and any tools required.
        """

        plan = self.llm.generate(planning_prompt)
        return self._parse_plan(plan)

    def _parse_plan(self, plan_text):
        """Parse the plan text into structured steps"""
        # Implementation to extract steps from plan text
        # ...
        return parsed_steps

```

#### The Execution Module

This component takes the plan and executes each step:

```hljs hljs python
Copyclass ExecutionModule:
    def __init__(self, llm, tools):
        self.llm = llm
        self.tools = tools  # Dictionary of tool_name -> tool_function
        self.memory = []    # Store execution history

    def execute_step(self, step, context):
        """Execute a single step from the plan"""
        execution_prompt = f"""
        % Role:
        You are an AI assistant executing a specific task step.

        % Task:
        Execute the following step as part of a larger plan.

        % Memory:
        Previous steps completed: {self.memory}

        % Current Step:
        {step}

        % Context:
        {context}

        % Instructions:
        Determine which tool to use for this step.
        Format your response as a JSON with the tool name and parameters.

        % Output Format:
        {{
            "tool": "tool_name",
            "parameters": {{
                "param1": "value1",
                "param2": "value2"
            }}
        }}
        """

        tool_call = self.llm.generate(execution_prompt)
        parsed_call = json.loads(tool_call)

        # Execute the tool
        if parsed_call["tool"] in self.tools:
            result = self.tools[parsed_call["tool"]](**parsed_call["parameters"])
            self.memory.append({"step": step, "result": result})
            return result
        else:
            return f"Error: Tool {parsed_call['tool']} not found"

```

#### The Monitoring and Re-planning Module

This component tracks progress and adjusts the plan when needed:

```hljs hljs python
Copyclass MonitoringModule:
    def __init__(self, planner, executor):
        self.planner = planner
        self.executor = executor

    def monitor_execution(self, original_plan, current_step_index, execution_results):
        """Check if we need to replan based on execution results"""
        monitoring_prompt = f"""
        % Role:
        You are an AI assistant monitoring the execution of a plan.

        % Original Plan:
        {original_plan}

        % Current Progress:
        Steps completed: {execution_results[:current_step_index]}
        Current step: {original_plan[current_step_index]}
        Execution result: {execution_results[current_step_index]}

        % Instructions:
        Determine if the plan needs to be adjusted based on the execution results.
        If the step was completed successfully, return "CONTINUE".
        If we need to adjust the plan, return "REPLAN" and explain why.

        % Output:
        Your decision and explanation.
        """

        decision = self.llm.generate(monitoring_prompt)

        if "REPLAN" in decision:
            # Generate a new plan from the current point
            new_plan = self.planner.create_plan(f"Continue from: {execution_results[current_step_index]}")
            return {"action": "replan", "new_plan": new_plan}
        else:
            return {"action": "continue"}

```

### 2\. Main Agent Class

This integrates all components into a unified agent:

```hljs hljs python
Copyclass PlannerAgent:
    def __init__(self, llm, tools):
        self.llm = llm
        self.tools = tools
        self.planner = PlanningModule(llm)
        self.executor = ExecutionModule(llm, tools)
        self.monitor = MonitoringModule(self.planner, self.executor)

    def run(self, user_task):
        """Execute the full planning and execution cycle"""
        # Step 1: Create initial plan
        plan = self.planner.create_plan(user_task)
        execution_results = []

        # Step 2: Execute plan steps
        current_step = 0
        while current_step < len(plan):
            # Execute current step
            result = self.executor.execute_step(plan[current_step], execution_results)
            execution_results.append(result)

            # Monitor and potentially replan
            monitoring_result = self.monitor.monitor_execution(
                plan, current_step, execution_results
            )

            if monitoring_result["action"] == "replan":
                # Update plan with new steps
                plan = plan[:current_step+1] + monitoring_result["new_plan"]

            current_step += 1

        # Step 3: Generate final response summarizing what was done
        final_prompt = f"""
        % Role:
        You are an AI assistant presenting results to a user.

        % Task:
        Summarize the execution of a plan for the user.

        % Original Task:
        {user_task}

        % Plan Executed:
        {plan}

        % Results:
        {execution_results}

        % Instructions:
        Create a clear, concise summary of what was accomplished.
        Highlight any important findings or outcomes.
        If any steps couldn't be completed, explain why.

        % Output:
        A user-friendly summary of the completed task.
        """

        final_summary = self.llm.generate(final_prompt)
        return {
            "original_task": user_task,
            "plan": plan,
            "execution_results": execution_results,
            "summary": final_summary
        }

```

## Advanced Techniques Inspired by Genspark.ai

Based on what we learned about Genspark's Super Agent approach, here are some advanced techniques to incorporate:

### 1\. Multi-Model Orchestration

Genspark utilizes multiple specialized LLMs for different aspects of the planning and execution process:

```hljs hljs python
Copyclass MultiModelOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.planning_model = load_planning_llm()  # Higher reasoning capabilities
        self.execution_model = load_execution_llm()  # More efficient for specific tasks
        self.reasoning_model = load_reasoning_llm()  # For complex decision-making

    def route_to_appropriate_model(self, task_type, prompt):
        """Route the task to the most appropriate model"""
        if task_type == "planning":
            return self.planning_model.generate(prompt)
        elif task_type == "execution":
            return self.execution_model.generate(prompt)
        elif task_type == "reasoning":
            return self.reasoning_model.generate(prompt)

```

### 2\. Tool Integration at Scale

Genspark's Super Agent integrates over 80 tools. Here's how you can manage a large tool ecosystem:

```hljs hljs python
Copyclass ToolManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tools = {}
        self.tool_descriptions = {}

    def register_tool(self, name, function, description, required_params=None):
        """Register a new tool with the manager"""
        self.tools[name] = function
        self.tool_descriptions[name] = {
            "description": description,
            "required_params": required_params or []
        }

    def get_tool_descriptions_for_context(self, context):
        """Return tool descriptions relevant to the given context"""
        # Use embeddings or keyword matching to find relevant tools
        relevant_tools = self._find_relevant_tools(context)

        descriptions = ""
        for tool in relevant_tools:
            desc = self.tool_descriptions[tool]
            descriptions += f"Tool: {tool}\nDescription: {desc['description']}\n"
            if desc["required_params"]:
                descriptions += f"Required parameters: {', '.join(desc['required_params'])}\n"
            descriptions += "\n"

        return descriptions

    def _find_relevant_tools(self, context):
        """Find tools relevant to the given context"""
        # Implementation using embeddings or keyword matching
        # ...
        return relevant_tools

```

### 3\. Thought Process Visualization

Genspark's Super Agent visualizes its reasoning process to users:

```hljs hljs python
Copyclass ThoughtVisualizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.thought_steps = []

    def add_thought(self, phase, content):
        """Add a thought step to the visualization"""
        self.thought_steps.append({
            "phase": phase,  # planning, execution, monitoring, etc.
            "content": content,
            "timestamp": datetime.now()
        })

    def generate_visualization(self):
        """Generate HTML/CSS for visualizing the thought process"""
        html = "<div class='thought-process'>"
        for step in self.thought_steps:
            html += f"""
            <div class='thought-step {step["phase"]}'>
                <div class='timestamp'>{step["timestamp"].strftime("%H:%M:%S")}</div>
                <div class='phase-badge'>{step["phase"].upper()}</div>
                <div class='thought-content'>{step["content"]}</div>
            </div>
            """
        html += "</div>"
        return html

```

## Implementation Steps

To create a planner agent similar to Genspark.ai's Super Agent, follow these steps:

### 1\. Set Up Your Environment

```hljs hljs bash
Copy# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv planner-agent-env
source planner-agent-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: planner-agent-env\Scripts\activate

# Install required packages
pip install langchain openai tiktoken pydantic httpx requests bs4

```

### 2\. Define Your Tool Set

Start with a core set of tools that cover common needs:

```hljs hljs python
Copydef register_core_tools(tool_manager):
    # Web search tool
    tool_manager.register_tool(
        name="web_search",
        function=search_web,
        description="Search the web for information on a topic",
        required_params=["query"]
    )

    # Document fetcher
    tool_manager.register_tool(
        name="fetch_document",
        function=fetch_document,
        description="Fetch and read content from a URL",
        required_params=["url"]
    )

    # Calculator
    tool_manager.register_tool(
        name="calculate",
        function=calculate_expression,
        description="Calculate a mathematical expression",
        required_params=["expression"]
    )

    # Calendar operations
    tool_manager.register_tool(
        name="check_calendar",
        function=check_calendar,
        description="Check calendar for available time slots",
        required_params=["date", "time_range"]
    )

```

### 3\. Implement the Plan-and-Execute Loop

The core execution loop should look like this:

```hljs hljs python
Copydef plan_and_execute(user_task, llm, tools):
    # 1. Create initial plan
    planner = PlanningModule(llm)
    plan = planner.create_plan(user_task)

    # 2. Show plan to user and get confirmation
    print("I've created a plan to accomplish your task:")
    for i, step in enumerate(plan):
        print(f"Step {i+1}: {step}")

    confirmation = input("Should I proceed with this plan? (yes/no): ")
    if confirmation.lower() != "yes":
        return "Task cancelled by user"

    # 3. Execute plan steps
    executor = ExecutionModule(llm, tools)
    monitor = MonitoringModule(planner, executor)

    execution_results = []
    current_step = 0

    while current_step < len(plan):
        print(f"\nExecuting step {current_step+1}: {plan[current_step]}")

        # Execute current step
        result = executor.execute_step(plan[current_step], execution_results)
        execution_results.append(result)

        print(f"Result: {result}")

        # Monitor and potentially replan
        monitoring_result = monitor.monitor_execution(
            plan, current_step, execution_results
        )

        if monitoring_result["action"] == "replan":
            print("Replanning necessary. Updating plan...")
            # Update plan with new steps
            new_steps = monitoring_result["new_plan"]
            plan = plan[:current_step+1] + new_steps
            print("Updated plan:")
            for i, step in enumerate(plan[current_step+1:], start=current_step+1):
                print(f"Step {i+1}: {step}")

        current_step += 1

    # 4. Generate summary
    final_summary = generate_summary(user_task, plan, execution_results)
    return final_summary

```

### 4\. Implement Advanced Features

To make your planner agent even more similar to Genspark's Super Agent, add these advanced features:

#### Dynamic Tool Selection

```hljs hljs python
Copydef select_tools_for_step(step_description, all_tools):
    """Dynamically select which tools are relevant for a given step"""
    embedding = get_embedding(step_description)

    # Get embeddings for all tool descriptions
    tool_embeddings = {
        tool_name: get_embedding(tool_info["description"])
        for tool_name, tool_info in all_tools.items()
    }

    # Calculate similarity scores
    similarities = {
        tool_name: cosine_similarity(embedding, tool_embedding)
        for tool_name, tool_embedding in tool_embeddings.items()
    }

    # Select tools above a threshold
    relevant_tools = {
        tool_name: tool_info
        for tool_name, tool_info in all_tools.items()
        if similarities[tool_name] > 0.7  # Threshold
    }

    return relevant_tools

```

#### Multi-Modal Interactions

```hljs hljs python
Copydef process_multi_modal_input(user_input):
    """Process different types of user input (text, images, voice)"""
    if isinstance(user_input, str):
        # Text input
        return {"type": "text", "content": user_input}
    elif hasattr(user_input, "read") and callable(user_input.read):
        # File-like object (image)
        return {"type": "image", "content": process_image(user_input)}
    elif isinstance(user_input, bytes) and is_audio(user_input):
        # Audio input
        return {"type": "audio", "content": transcribe_audio(user_input)}
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported input type")

```

#### Incremental Plan Execution

```hljs hljs python
Copydef execute_plan_with_feedback(plan, executor, tools, user_feedback_interval=3):
    """Execute plan with periodic user feedback"""
    results = []

    for i, step in enumerate(plan):
        # Execute step
        result = executor.execute_step(step, results)
        results.append(result)

        # Ask for user feedback periodically
        if (i + 1) % user_feedback_interval == 0 and i + 1 < len(plan):
            print(f"\nCompleted steps 1-{i+1}. Results so far: {results}")
            feedback = input("Any adjustments needed before continuing? (Enter to continue, or type feedback): ")

            if feedback.strip():
                # Adjust plan based on feedback
                adjusted_plan = adjust_plan_with_feedback(plan[i+1:], feedback)
                plan = plan[:i+1] + adjusted_plan
                print("Plan adjusted based on feedback.")

    return results

```

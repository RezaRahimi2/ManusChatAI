# CortexON Analysis

Based on examining the CortexON GitHub repository, I've gathered the following key information about its architecture and implementation:

## Overview

CortexON is an open-source, multi-agent AI system inspired by advanced agent platforms such as Manus and OpenAI DeepResearch. It's designed to automate and simplify everyday tasks, with a focus on complex workflows including research, technical operations, and business process automations.

## Multi-Agent Architecture

CortexON uses a specialized multi-agent architecture with agents that dynamically collaborate:

1. **Web Agent**: Handles internet searches, data retrieval, and web interactions
2. **File Agent**: Manages file operations, organization, data extraction, and storage
3. **Coder Agent**: Generates, debugs, and optimizes code across various programming languages
4. **Executor Agent**: Executes tasks, manages workflows, and orchestrates inter-agent communications
5. **API Agent**: Integrates with external services, APIs, and third-party software

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: PydanticAI multi-agent framework
- **Headless Browser**: Browserbase (Web Agent)
- **Search Engine**: Google SERP
- **Logging & Observability**: Pydantic Logfire
- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Shadcn

## LLM Integration

CortexON primarily uses Anthropic's Claude models:
- Default model: `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`
- Requires Anthropic API key

## Key Capabilities

- Advanced, context-aware research automation
- Dynamic multi-agent orchestration
- Seamless integration with third-party APIs and services
- Code generation, debugging, and execution
- Efficient file and data management
- Personalized and interactive task execution

## Deployment

CortexON uses Docker for containerization and deployment:
- Docker Compose for multi-container setup
- Environment variables for configuration
- Optional HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Vault integration for secure secrets management

## Services

When deployed, CortexON exposes several services:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- CortexON Backend: http://localhost:8081
- Agentic Browser: http://localhost:8000

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized with the following main components:
- **cortex_on/**: Core functionality
- **frontend/**: React-based user interface
- **ta-browser/**: Browser automation component
- **assets/**: Static assets and resources

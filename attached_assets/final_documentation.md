# Manus AI Clone with UI and Local LLM Integration

This document provides a summary of all the deliverables created for implementing a Manus AI clone with UI and local LLM integration.

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive guide to creating a functional clone of Manus AI that runs entirely locally, with a modern UI and support for various local LLM options. The implementation follows a modular architecture with these key components:

1. **Multi-Agent System**: A flexible architecture with specialized agents for different tasks
2. **LLM Integration Layer**: Support for multiple local LLM providers (Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp)
3. **Tool Framework**: Extensible system for adding capabilities to agents
4. **Memory System**: Efficient context management with multiple memory types
5. **UI Components**: Modern, responsive interface built with React and TypeScript
6. **Backend Services**: FastAPI-based server for handling client-server communication

## Deliverables

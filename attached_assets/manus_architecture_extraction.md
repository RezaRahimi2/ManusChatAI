# Manus AI Architecture Extraction

Based on the analysis of all provided resources, I've extracted the core architecture of Manus AI and similar systems to create a comprehensive understanding of how to build a clone with local LLM integration.

## Core Architecture Components

### 1. Multi-Agent System

Manus AI uses a multi-agent architecture where specialized agents collaborate to accomplish complex tasks:

- **Main Agent (Manus)**: Central orchestrator that processes user requests and delegates to specialized agents
- **Browser Agent**: Handles web browsing, search, and web-based interactions
- **Tool Call Agent**: Manages the execution of various tools and utilities
- **React Agent**: Implements the ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) pattern for complex problem-solving
- **SWE Agent**: Specialized for software engineering and coding tasks

### 2. LLM Integration Layer

- **Model Router**: Directs requests to appropriate LLM models based on task requirements
- **Context Management**: Handles prompt engineering, context windows, and memory
- **API Connectors**: Interfaces with various LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
- **Vision Capabilities**: Support for multimodal inputs (images, documents)

### 3. Tool Framework

- **Tool Collection**: Extensible set of tools for various tasks
- **Tool Registry**: Mechanism to register and discover available tools
- **Tool Execution**: Standardized interface for tool invocation and result handling
- **Tool Documentation**: Self-documenting tools for LLM understanding

### 4. Memory System

- **Short-term Memory**: Maintains conversation context
- **Long-term Memory**: Stores persistent information across sessions
- **Vector Database**: Enables semantic search and retrieval
- **Knowledge Graph**: Connects related information in structured format

### 5. UI Components

- **Chat Interface**: Primary user interaction point
- **Results Display**: Shows outputs, code, and generated content
- **Tool Visualization**: Displays tool usage and execution
- **Settings Panel**: Configures agent behavior and LLM settings

### 6. Backend Services

- **API Server**: Handles client-server communication
- **Task Queue**: Manages asynchronous operations
- **Authentication**: User identity and access control
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Tracks system performance and errors

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**: Request enters through UI or API
2. **Request Processing**: Main agent analyzes and plans approach
3. **Agent Selection**: Task is routed to appropriate specialized agent
4. **Tool Selection**: Agent selects necessary tools for the task
5. **LLM Consultation**: Agent consults LLM for reasoning and decision-making
6. **Tool Execution**: Selected tools are executed with appropriate parameters
7. **Result Integration**: Results from tools are integrated into response
8. **Memory Update**: Conversation and results are stored in memory
9. **Response Generation**: Final response is generated and formatted
10. **User Presentation**: Response is presented through UI

## Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Agent Orchestration**: Coordination between multiple specialized agents
2. **Tool-Augmented LLM**: Enhancing LLM capabilities with external tools
3. **Prompt Engineering**: Structured prompts for consistent agent behavior
4. **Context Management**: Handling limited context windows efficiently
5. **Modular Design**: Extensible architecture for adding new capabilities

## Local LLM Integration Approaches

Based on the analyzed repositories, there are several approaches to local LLM integration:

1. **Ollama Integration** (AgenticSeek approach):
   - Uses Ollama server to run models locally
   - Configurable model selection
   - Supports various model sizes based on hardware capabilities

2. **LlamaCPP Integration**:
   - Direct integration with llama.cpp for optimized inference
   - Supports quantized models for efficiency
   - Lower resource requirements than Ollama

3. **Server-Client Architecture** (AgenticSeek approach):
   - Run LLM on a separate powerful machine
   - Connect via network from client machine
   - Flexible deployment options

4. **API Compatibility Layer**:
   - Local endpoints that mimic OpenAI API
   - Compatible with existing code expecting OpenAI format
   - Examples: LM Studio, LocalAI, vLLM

5. **Model Context Protocol** (OWL approach):
   - Standardized protocol for model interactions
   - Abstracts away differences between model providers
   - Enables seamless switching between local and cloud models
